Ninety-Nine Scala Problems

These are an adaptation of the Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems written by Werner Hett at the Berne University of Applied Sciences in Berne, Switzerland.
I (Tony Zhou) have altered them to be more amenable to programming in Scala.
Feedback is appreciated.

The problems have different levels of difficulty.
Those marked with a single asterisk (*) are easy. 
If you have successfully solved the preceeding problems you should be able to solve them within a few (say 15) minutes. 
Problems marked with two asterisks (**) are of intermediate difficulty. 
If you are a skilled Scala programmer it shouldn't take you more than 30-90 minutes to solve them. 
Problems marked with three asterisks (***) are more difficult. 
You may need more time (i.e. a few hours or more) to find a good solution. 
The difficulties were all assigned for the Prolog problems, but the Scala versions seem to be of roughly similar difficulty.
