# 99 Scala Problems

These are an adaptation of the Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems written by Werner Hett at the Berne University of Applied Sciences in Berne, Switzerland.
I (**Tony Zhou**) have altered them to be more amenable to program and practice in Scala.


The problems have different levels of difficulty.
1. Those marked with a single asterisk (*) are easy.
2. Problems marked with two asterisks (**) are of intermediate difficulty.
3. Problems marked with three asterisks (***) are more difficult.

The difficulties were all assigned for the Prolog problems, but the Scala versions seem to be of roughly similar difficulty.
